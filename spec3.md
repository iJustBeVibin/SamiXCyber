## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Dimensional Risk Scoring**
- **Overall Risk Score** (0-100)
- **Four Risk Categories**:
  - Security (40% weight): Audits, code quality, centralization
  - Financial (30% weight): TVL, volatility, liquidity
  - Operational (20% weight): Team, governance, transparency
  - Market (10% weight): Adoption, competition, trends

### 2. **Clear Risk Explanations**
- Plain English descriptions of risks
- Actionable insights for each risk category
- Specific recommendations and concerns
- Historical context and comparisons

### 3. **Visual Risk Dashboard**
- **Protocol Cards**: Quick overview with color-coded scores
- **Risk Radar Charts**: Visual breakdown of risk categories
- **Traffic Light System**: Red/Yellow/Green risk indicators
- **Comparative Analysis**: Risk relative to similar protocols

### 4. **Protocol Detail Views**
- Detailed risk breakdown per category
- Specific vulnerability explanations
- Team and governance transparency
- Historical risk score tracking

### 5. **Real-Time Data Aggregation**
- Live data from multiple sources
- Automated score recalculation
- API failover and caching strategies
- Regular data refresh cycles

### 6. **User-Centric Design**
- Clean, minimal interface focused on clarity
- Progressive disclosure (simple â†’ detailed)
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Intuitive navigation and filtering

## ðŸš€ Prototype Scope

### **Included for MVP:**
- 5-10 major Ethereum protocols (Aave, Uniswap, Compound, etc.)
- Basic risk scoring algorithm
- Core dashboard with protocol list and detail views
- Integration with 2-3 primary APIs
- Responsive web interface

### **Planned for Future:**
- Hedera Hashgraph integration

## ðŸ’¡ Unique Value Proposition

**"We don't just show scores - we explain the 'why' behind the risk"**

Unlike competitors that only display numerical scores, this dashboard provides:
- **Contextual explanations** in plain language
- **Specific risk factors** with actionable insights
- **Comparative analysis** against industry standards
- **Transparent scoring methodology**

This prototype delivers a foundation for informed DeFi decision-making by transforming complex on-chain data into clear, understandable risk assessments.
